This is a project that was undertaken by me for Rajalakshmi Engineering College, Thandalam
The requirement was to convert the indoor auditorium into an IOT enabled one under the smart campus initiative.
The auditorium has 154 lights connected to 4 different switch panels.]

The auditorium lights are now remotely controllable world-wide with any internet connected device(phone,laptop,smart watch)
4 ESP32's and relay modules are installed in the panels.

A cross platform application along with a responsive website was create to control the lights.
